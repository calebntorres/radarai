An application of GAN's to time series data for radar image prediction

Working on a solution to use GAN's for time series prediction of radar image data. Scope of the project is to train a GAN for generating radar images and time series loops given a current image-state. More informally, this also serves as learning experience in Python, creating data pipelines, training machine learning models and eventually developing web applications. 

# Updates as of Dec 19, 2021
Working on data pipeline. So far I've created a class for connecting to the nexrad level 2 S3 bucket. Also working some functions to help with fetching particular
images and sets of images.
